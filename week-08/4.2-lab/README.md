Week 8 | 4.2

## Introduction

This lab is divided into two sections. One we'll manually compute some of the Bayesian statistical testing procedures manually/step-wise using Python as a calculator, and the second half, we'll go ahead and use PyMC to go through the analysis and leverage the libraries to provide more automatic results for us.

The first thing we'll do is load up the data set, which contains 3 columns, the number of clicks for a website on a given day, the number of sales conversions (actual sales) on a given day, and whether it was the weekend.

>Note to instructor: This data is simulated, and I generated most of the click data using a Poisson process. Part of the "extra" challenge in this lab will be to see if the fast-learners can figure out which distribution to use outside of the normal distribution I've outlined here for them to use.


## Exercise

Exercises include going through basic hypothesis tests, implementing several stats tests via scikit-learn, and ending with an additional practice with pymc on building a univariate Bayesian regression



#### Requirements

- Building confidence intervals and differentiating them with credible intervals
- Building Bayesian stats tests with scikit-learn
- Building a PyMC model for a Bayesian regression


#### Starter code

Please utilize the starter code found in the directory to start the students on today's activities
