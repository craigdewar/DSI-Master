I feel that PyMc is also much more 'natural' as a library and is just easier to use. I recommended to Jeff we make the change and he agreed. You may want to look over the code and dedicate some time to going through basic method calls for PyMC. Since they have done this in PyStan, and there are very clear equivalences between the two, they should be able to pick this up much faster than just seeing it without any context the first time around.

It's also syntactically closer to what you'd be use to in scikit-learn and other Python/R method-calls. \n",

    "> From my understanding determining the type of missingness is an art, so I feel the students should think about how they individually would view this exercise as a \"first pass\" on the \"missingness\" of the data, and how it will serve their future analysis (weighting observations, doing some kind of correction to account for \"missingess\", or nothing at all etc.)\n",

    "**Open Ended Questions** So can we be fairly confident that there is some kind of functional relationship between the indicator variable and the few columns we studied in our data set? Is it obvious that there are probably other factors impacting \"missingness\" from this data? Which type of \"missingness\" are we probably in, and what does that say about the state of our missing data and how we should approach modeling on this data set in the future? What further actions can we take to augment this analysis?"

Remember, both in Python and R, building an empty container/structure before populating it with values is often more effecient with respect to run-time vis-a-vis iteratively adding rows/columns. Again, as we mature as data scientist, we will eventually need to think about these issues (especially as we build more complicated machine learning systems). "
