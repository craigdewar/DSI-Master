    "\n",
    ">Google wants to test if changing the size of the information card on the right side of the search results page will result in more people clicking on links inside of it. They construct two versions of their search results page, one with the original, \"control\" page where the box is 300px wide, and a new \"experimental\" page where the box is 301px wide.\n",
    "        \n",
    ">For one day, they funnel 90% of searchers to the control page and 10% to the experimental page. At the end of the day, they check the click rates for each and determine a winner.\n",

    "Good A/B test design applies scientific standards borrowed from experimental design in science. As is described above, A/B tests are really just experiments and hypothesis testing with a different name and context.\n"

    "### Setup of a Split Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies running as split test, and particularly the data scientists responsible for the construction and analysis of the test, should consider in detail the value, purpose, and setup of the test before beginning any _technical_ work. Four essential considerations before beginning a test are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. WHAT ELEMENTS WILL BE CHANGED IN THE PRODUCT?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data scientist typically work closely with Product or Project Managers (PMs). You will often have limited say in what elements are changed for a test, but this does not mean you should avoid \"weighing in\". In fact, it is essential as a data scientist to clearly communicate your opinion of the test since you are the most statistically savvy. At this stage in the process, ensuring the smallest/most limited changes are made will prevent false correlations in the data and have the most meaningful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. WHO WILL BE PART OF THE TESTING GROUPS (ARMS) AND BY HOW MUCH?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Will the test split incoming traffic 50/50 between variants? Should you serve the variant under test to a smaller group? Will the test split change? A common and safe practice is to begin by only showing the new variant(s) to a very small proportion of users to ensure there is nothing very wrong with the change, then performing the actual split test on a larger proportion of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. HOW LONG WILL THE TEST RUN?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very important question to ask. If the test doesn't run long enough, your data won't be useful. If it runs too long, that can impact business needs. _In the standard split test procedure, you cannot check the results multiple times!_ We will examine and explain why in a later section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. IS THE THE TEST NECESSARY? WHY?**\n",
    "\n",
