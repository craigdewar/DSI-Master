## Introduction

> To the instructor: It may be helpful to first assemble a list of questions from earlier lessons/labs and print them out in a single list to pass on to each student, so that they have the material on-hand (without having to go through the .ipynb or .md manually).

This lab will be very interactive. You're going to get into groups of 3 and do some role-playing!

## Exercise

First review the following lists of sample interview questions, as found on these sites:

1. http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/66-job-interview-questions-for-data-scientists

2. http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blog/show?id=6448529%3ABlogPost%3A371610

3. https://www.dezyre.com/article/100-data-science-interview-questions-and-answers-general-for-2016/184


Second, select 6 questions (feel free to select these from across all of the sources provided).

Third, get into groups of 3.

Fourth, distribute your questions equally among all members of your group. Make sure each of you have access to:

- Laptop
- Markers + White board.

Fifth, assign roles and rotational order. See the roles below.

Sixth, identify an additional *sample* question as a group before beginning. Calibrate among yourselves what is "acceptable" in terms of answer completion and discussion.

Seventh, take turns asking and answering each set of six questions within your groups. Alternate every 2 questions.

**ROLES**
- *The Interviewer* should ask the question, note the response, and ask follow-up questions accordingly. Put yourselves in the role of an interviewer: what items would they be most likely to follow up on?
- *The Interviewee* should answer the questions, demonstrate their logic, and prepare to answer follow-up questions.
- *The Notetaker* should take notes of the answers given by the Interviewee and look for gaps / issues to critique along with the Interviewer.


## Instructions
Do your best to answer the questions either on white board or in pseudo-code. If you choose to do pseudo-code format, have one laptop open with a blank Jupyter notebook. The person who is role-playing the Interviewer will sit in a chair next to you, and observe as you solve the question. The Notetaker will keep track of your response and assist the Interviewer with potential follow-up questions.


**Interviewer Tips:**
Remember not to let your interviewee hang. In real life, most interviews will provide gentle guiding questions or prompts if an interviewee gets stuck or doesn't understand a question. Be patient. It may take a while for an interviewee to think-through a problem! This isn't a race; in fact, one of the skills being practiced here is the ability to remain calm and poised under pressure.

**Interviewee Tips**
Practice "thinking out loud". Explain every step and why you are doing it (as if you were doing some user-testing). This is essential to pass real coding/white boarding challenges. Even if you get something wrong in a real challenge, you can still be hired if you explain your logic clearly, and demonstrate that you have the capability to think through a problem rigorously.  

**Notetaker Tips**
Keep track of what the interviewee says in order to provide them with a record of their response afterward. Also be on the lookout for issues, gaps, or areas to flag to help the Interviewer come up with follow-up questions. Finally, think about the questions and responses and provide feedback to your group members after each question set is completed.

**Final Advice**
Don't expect to be able to answer every question! This is a great time to practice what you would say to *tastefully avoid the fact that you do not have an answer* to a specific interview test/quiz question. This will happen. It happens to *everyone* at some point. It will not be your fault. But you should be prepared to deal with it tactfully.


#### Requirements

- Individually assemble a list of 6 questions from the sources given (or from your experience in class). Look for questions that interest, challenge, or confuse you.

- Form groups of 3. Assign roles and rotating order. Share questions.

*Note: if you've chosen overlapping questions, that's ok! It's a good sign that you have similar interest and challenges. Be sure to go back after answering and identify a few more to make up the number.*

- Talk through one additional *sample* question as a group before beginning. Calibrate among yourselves what is "acceptable" in terms of answer completion and discussion.

- Alternate. Do 2 questions for each person, and move on until all questions have been exhausted. Provide feedback to each other as needed.


**Bonus:**

- As a group, find 1-2 questions that none of you can answer and share with your instructor and the rest of the class. How would they approach this?


#### Starter code
N/A


#### Deliverable
Answer questions and provide feedback to each other in groups of 3.
