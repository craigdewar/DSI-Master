## Introduction

This lab is going to be very similar to the last one. We're going to practice our interview techniques, but focus on the skills covered in the whiteboarding lesson. You're going to get into a group of 3, but with different partners. Put your role playing hats back on!

## Exercise

Let's pull up those interview questions again.

You may also take a few minutes to search the web for some other problems. Here are some other options for you to choose from:

Individually, select 4 problems that are more involved. Go for the difficult ones, now is your time to practice. Also, for whiteboarding, it's best to select more concrete questions, i.e. "Write an algorithm that does X", rather than "Waht are the benefits of Y?". Afterwards, get in your groups, find some space where you have access to a whiteboard, and cooperatively select your 6 favorite questions. If you get through those, continue on to the rest.

You'll want to use the same rotational process as before. Here's a reminder of how that worked:

**ROLES**
- *The Interviewer* should ask the question, note the response, and ask follow-up questions accordingly. Put yourselves in the role of an interviewer: what items would they be most likely to follow up on?
- *The Interviewee* should answer the questions, demonstrate their logic, and prepare to answer follow-up questions.
- *The Notetaker* should take notes of the answers given by the Interviewee and look for gaps / issues to critique along with the Interviewer.


## Instructions

Walk through the problems and focus on the whiteboarding steps covered in the last lecture. Be sure to talk out your work. As the interviewer, it's your job to make sure everything is clear. Ask plenty of questions to drill down into the though process. *If you see a bug, don't tell the interviewee!* They'll need to discover it themselves, but you may gently guide them towards it with probing questions. You should focus on how it feels to interview someone. Putting yourself in the shoes of
your interviewer is a crucial skill that will help in all of your future interviews. 


#### Requirements

- Individually assemble a list of 6 questions from the sources given (or from your experience in class). The more difficult the better!.

- Form groups of 3. Assign roles and rotating order. Share questions.

- Talk through one additional *sample* question as a group before beginning. Calibrate among yourselves what is "acceptable" in terms of answer completion and discussion.

- Alternate. Do 1 questions for each person, and move on until all questions have been exhausted. Each question should take about 10-15 minutes. Provide feedback to each other as needed.

**Bonus:**
- As a group, find 1-2 problems that nobody in your group can answer and share with your instructor and the rest of the class. How would they approach this?

#### Starter code

N/A

#### Deliverable

Answer questions and provide feedback to eachother in a group of 3
