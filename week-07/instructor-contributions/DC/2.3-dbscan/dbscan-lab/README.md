##  DBSCAN on Airport Cancellations Data

Now that you've practiced one implementation of DBSCAN, we're going to be circling back to the FAA airport data from the previous lessons and perform a DBSCAN on it.

We want to look at the airport cancellations data, as a whole, and use DBSCAN to determine the clusters. Afterwards, we'll want to compare the results of the DBSCAN to those of a k-means to see the differentials in cluster assignments. As part of you're task, you'll have the experiment with various inputs of epsilon and minimum points for DBSCAN, as well as the value of "k" for k-means since this is a raw, dense dataset!

Although it may not always be apparent what the correct answer is - try your best with the knowledge that you have and the information given to you. If you get stuck, compare your solution with that of a classmate.

To start, open the starter code and download the data.

Where there any areas where you got stuck? What factors may have halted your analysis?
