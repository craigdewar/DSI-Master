# Resources

+ For a surprisingly comprehensive (yet dense!) review, be sure to check out [Linear algebra in four pages](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~lototsky/MATH408/LinAlg1.pdf)
+ This [deck](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi05/cse252a/linear_algebra_review.pdf) provides great insight into linear operations and advanced geometric topics
+ Stanford's Review and Reference [26-page](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf) guide provides a nice review
+ No math reference section is complete with a shoutout to [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra/matrix-transformations#concept-intro)
+ This six minute [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsXmIKdG8P8) [part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzzCAWJVu8w) YouTube series is a funny, global, accelerated overview
+ Carnegie Mellon has a cohesive [linear algebra review](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/linalg/special_matrices.html) - complete with decks and videos for every step along the way. At least watch the video on [linear algebra notation](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/linalg/basic_notation.html)
+ This [seven minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UStcLq-nW24) may leave you scratching your head, but it introduces linear algebra in a geometric fashion
