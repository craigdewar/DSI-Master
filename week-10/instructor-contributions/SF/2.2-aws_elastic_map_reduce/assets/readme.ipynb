    "\n",
    "Amazon Elastic MapReduce was introduce in April 2009 to automate _provisioning_ of the Hadoop cluster, running and terminating jobs, and handling data transfer between EC2(VM) and S3(Object Storage). It simplifies the management of a Hadoop cluster, making it available to anyone at the click of a button.\n",
    "\n",
    "EMR offers several pre-installed software packages including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hadoop\n",
    "- HBase\n",
    "- Pig\n",
    "- Hive\n",
    "- Hue\n",
    "- Spark\n",
    "and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "EMR also supports spot Instances since 2011. It is recommended to only run the Task Instance Group on spot instances to take advantage of the lower cost while maintaining availability.\n",

    "**Check:** Which of these have you already encountered on your local VM?\n",
    "> Hadoop, Hive\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### EMR Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "EMR Pricing is based on the type of instances forming the cluster and it's divided in tiers. The pricing adds to the cost of spinning up the instances in EC2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, very importantly, costs are calculated in hourly increments, so if we plan to use the cluster for 2 sessions of half an hour, we should have it up for 1 hour consecutively instead of spinning it up and down twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "EMR is not included in the AWS free tier that you've used in the previous class, so it's always a good practice to do some price checking before you sping up a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the [AWS cost calculator](https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) to estimate the cost of a 3 nodes cluster with medium size instances `(m3.xlarge)`. The image below shows the cost for 1 hour: it's slightly more than 1 dollar.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./assets/images/emrcost.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to keep the cluster alive for a month, that would result in a pretty high price, that's why it's so convenient to spin up and down clusters as they are needed."
