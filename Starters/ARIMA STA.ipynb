    "In regession and classification, we use features (collected during a cross-sectional study/survey/measurement) to predict an outcome. The model and parameters represent part of the underlying relationship between features and outcome. But what if we run out of funds to cross-section, or need to predict future outcomes for which the features don't exist yet?\n",

    "Enter [Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average) modeling. When we have autocorrelation between outcomes and their ancestors, we will see a theme, or relationship in the outcome plot. This relationship can be modeled in its own way, allowing us to predict the future with a confidence level commensurate to the strength of the relationship and the proximity to known values (prediction weakens the further out we go)."
