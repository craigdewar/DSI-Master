## Introduction

It's been a long week, and we've covered a lot of ground. For this lab, you'll get to choose your own adventure. This will be a light lab that will either make sure you're ready for the presentations later today, or will give you the chance to add to your portfolio by writing a short blog post.


## Exercise

### **Option 1:** Get one last chance to finish up your West Nile Virus project

Presentations will be later today, if you do not feel that you are prepared, then you and your group should take this time to finalize everything. Be sure to review all of the deliverable requirements, or check with your instructor, to ensure you have everything ready.

### **Option 2:** Write a blog post about Time Series Analysis.

Author and publish a tutorial blog post walking through ARIMA/SARIMA analysis. The goal is to choose a dataset and walk the user through analysing the data using a model of your choice. You will be expected to include coding samples and graphics describing your approach. It is not required that you provide predictions from your model, but we will be looking for your EDA techniques and first attempts at fitting your model

You may choose your own dataset. We recommend this library featuring hundreds of time series datasets: https://datamarket.com/data/list/?q=provider:tsdl

#### Requirements _(for the blog post option)_

- Explore your data set and describe the observations
- Describe any cleaning that you needed to do
- Provide ACF/PACF graphs and describe your observations
- Attempt to fit an ARMA/ARIMA/SARIMA model using your data

**Bonus:**
- Use the Box-Ljung test to examine fit
- Provide predictions for your dataset


#### Deliverable

Your blog post should be published on a blogging platform of your choice. This is your chance to show the world- including future employers- what you know.
