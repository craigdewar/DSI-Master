Use [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durbin%E2%80%93Watson_statistic) as reference, but don't just copy and paste the code from yesterday.  As a data scientist, it's important that you be able to translate mathematical formulas into code.  The function should take as input the residuals (just a 1d array of numbers) and output the Durbin-Watson statistic, which is used to determine the presence or absense of first order serial correlation."
